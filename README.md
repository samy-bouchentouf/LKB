# LKB AI Hub

LKB AI Hub is a knowledge management platform designed for the Kastler Brossel Laboratory.

The platform centralizes, structures and enriches laboratory knowledge through:

- Scientific publications
- Technical component documentation
- Experimental diagrams
- Incident reports
- AI-assisted knowledge retrieval

The application combines modern document management with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture powered by:

- Chroma Vector Database
- Mistral Embeddings
- Mistral Large Language Models

---

# Architecture

# Running the Application

The application uses a single command to start both services:

- FastAPI Chatbot Service
- Express Backend

## Start the Application

From the project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Alternatively:

```bash
npm start
```

Both commands start:

```text
FastAPI Chatbot Service
http://localhost:8000

Express Backend
http://localhost:3000
```

The chatbot API documentation is available at:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

The web application is available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The Express backend automatically serves the frontend.

During startup, both services display their status directly in the terminal.

Example:

```text
[CHATBOT] ==================================
[CHATBOT] [INFO] LKB AI Hub Chatbot Started
[CHATBOT] [INFO] Chatbot running on port 8000
[CHATBOT] [INFO] API documentation available at http://localhost:8000/docs
[CHATBOT] ==================================

[BACKEND] ==================================
[BACKEND] [INFO] LKB AI Hub Backend Started
[BACKEND] [INFO] Server running on port 3000
[BACKEND] [INFO] Application available at http://localhost:3000
[BACKEND] ==================================

# Functional Overview

The platform is organized around six modules:

```text
Home
Chat
Publications
Components
Diagrams
Incidents
```

---

# Home

The Home page provides:

- Knowledge base statistics
- Quick Question entry point
- Direct access to all resources

Displayed statistics include:

```text
Publications
Components
Diagrams
Incidents
```

For diagrams, only user-visible PNG files are counted.

## Quick Question

Questions entered from the Home page automatically redirect users to the Chat page.

```text

↓
Quick Question
↓
Chat
↓
Generated Answer
```

---

# Chat

The Chat page exposes the AI assistant.

Questions are processed through:

```text
Question
↓
Mistral Embedding Generation
↓
Chroma Similarity Search
↓
Top 5 Relevant Chunks Retrieval
↓
Context Construction
↓
Mistral Large
↓
Answer
```

Responses include:

- Generated answer
- Supporting source documents

The assistant can use information from:

- Publications
- Components
- Incident reports
- Diagram descriptions

stored inside the knowledge base.

---

# Publications

Storage location:

```text
documents/publications/
```

## Features

- Drag & Drop upload
- File Explorer upload
- Search
- Sorting
- Open
- Download

# Diagrams

Storage location:

```text

## Connections

Each connection stores:

```text
Name
Color
Source Component
Target Component
```

Users can:

- Create connections
- Rename connections
- Delete connections
- Edit connection attributes

Updates are automatically reflected throughout the diagram.

## Diagram Persistence

Saving a diagram generates:

```text

Positions
Colors
Names
```

The PNG representation is intended for visualization.

Only PNG files are displayed in the diagram library.

- Dynamic content sizing

---

# File Conflict Management

The platform prevents accidental data loss caused by duplicate file names.

Whenever a conflict is detected, a dedicated modal is displayed.

---

## Publications & Components

File name conflicts are detected during both:

- Upload operations
- Rename operations

### Upload Conflict

```text
File Conflict
↓
Cancel
Rename
Overwrite
```

#### Cancel

Aborts the upload.

#### Rename

Uploads the document under an automatically generated temporary name and immediately opens the Rename workflow, allowing the user to choose a final name.

#### Overwrite

Replaces the existing document with the uploaded version.

### Rename Conflict

```text
File Conflict
↓
Cancel
Rename
```

Existing files cannot be overwritten through a rename operation.

---

## Diagrams

When saving an existing diagram:

```text
Save Diagram
↓
Name Already Exists
↓
Cancel
Rename
Overwrite
```

### Cancel

Aborts the save.

### Rename

Allows another diagram name to be specified.

### Overwrite

Replaces both:

```text
diagram-name.png
diagram-name.json
```

with the new version.

---

## Incidents

When saving an existing incident report:

```text
Save Incident
↓
Title Already Exists
↓
Cancel
Rename
Overwrite
```

### Cancel

Aborts the save.

### Rename

Allows another title to be specified.

### Overwrite

Replaces the existing PDF report.

---

# Knowledge Base Synchronization

The chatbot uses a persistent Chroma database.

The knowledge base is automatically synchronized when the chatbot starts and whenever document modifications require an update.

Synchronization is hash-based and incremental.

Each document receives a SHA256 content hash.

During synchronization:

```text
Documents on Disk
↓
SHA256 Hash Comparison
↓
Documents Added to Chroma

or

Documents Removed from Disk
↓
Removed from Chroma
```

Only documents whose content is not already present in the vector database are indexed.

## Synchronization Required

```text
Upload Publication
Delete Publication

Upload Component
Delete Component
```

These actions trigger:

```text
POST /sync
```

towards the chatbot service.

## Synchronization Not Required

```text
Rename Publication
Rename Component
Rename Diagram
Rename Incident
```

because document content remains unchanged.

---

# Chatbot Architecture

The chatbot is implemented as an independent FastAPI service.

Available endpoints:

```text
POST /ask
POST /sync
```

## Question Answering Flow

```text
Frontend
↓
POST /api/chat
↓
Express Backend
↓
POST /ask
↓
Mistral Embedding Generation
↓
Chroma Similarity Search
↓
Context Construction
↓
Mistral Large
↓
Response
```

## Synchronization Flow

```text
Document Modification
↓
Express Backend
↓
POST /sync
↓
SHA256 Hash Comparison
↓
Document Indexing or Removal
↓
Chroma Update
```
